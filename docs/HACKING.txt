This repository also contains number of tools and utilities for examining
and modifying Thinkpad Embedded Controller firmware.

Including:
*   radare projects with partial disassembly of several thinkpads EC firmware
*   scripts for downloading the ISO image and extracting the firmware
*   script for patching the firmware
*   documentation on the tables found in the firmware (TODO)

Radare:
-------
To use the radare projects, first install the project files:

    make install.radare.projects

Then ensure you have the image file(s):

    make x200.7XHT24WW.img x220.8DHT34WW.img x230.G2HT35WW.img x260.R02HT29W.img

Then start radare with one of these projects:

    radare -p x230.G2HT35WW

Makefile targets:
-----------------

If you expect to do development work, the following make targets are
probably useful:

    To list the available raw image files and FL2 files, check the
    Descriptions.txt file for the list of known image names.  You
    can also get a list of the "*.img.d" directories that contain
    patches with this make command:

        make list_images

    To fetch the firmware from Lenovo, extract, decrypt and patch
    it, ready for more patching:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img

    To just get the decrypted firmware file (with the same filename as
    above), before any patches applied:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img.prepatch

    To create a new FL2, ready for flashing:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.s01D3000.FL2

    To update your firmware, copy the FL2 file generated above and
    the dosflash.exe utility to a DOS boot disk and then use a command
    similar to:


        dosflash /sd /ipf ec /file s01D3000.FL2

    To insert the firmware image back into the bootable cdrom and boot this
    in an emulator for testing:

        make patched.x230.iso.test

    To extract the DOS disk image from the ISO and test that in the emulator
    instead:

        make patched.x230.img.test
