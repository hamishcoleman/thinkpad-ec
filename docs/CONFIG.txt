Configuring which patches are used
----------------------------------

This repository has contains the following sets of patches for various ThinkPad models:

* Patch to use the classical IBM keyboard instead of the newer Lenovo chiclet keyboard.
* Turning off the authentic battery validation check.
  The battery patches are disabled by default, but are easy to enable.
* Swap Fn and CtlL keys so that the physical layout becomes CtlL, Fn (how it should be).
  For older Thinkpad models like the xx00 series the EC can not be configured
  to swap Fn and Ctrl. This setting would usually be exposed in the BIOS setup
  or in nvram when using coreboot.
  Enabled by default for models where this can not be configured.

Any combination of the two sets of patches can be enabled or disabled
(even including a version with no patches at all - to revert all changes)

There are several makefile targets that exist to help you configure which
patches are enabled.  Choose one or more of the following commands to
configure as you want:

    make patch_enable_battery clean       # Uses the battery validate patch
    make patch_disable_battery clean      # Turns off the battery validate patch
    make patch_enable_keyboard clean      # Uses the keyboard patches
    make patch_disable_keyboard clean     # Turns off the keyboard patches
    make patch_enable_fn_ctrl_swap clean  # Uses the Fn and CtlL key swap patch
    make patch_disable_fn_ctrl_swap clean # Turns off the Fn and CtlL key swap patch

Behind the scenes
-----------------

Each hardware and EC firmware version combination needs its own set of
patches, which are stored in directories called "*.img.d" - the disable
commands are simply renaming the patch files to have a suffix of ".OFF"
(or removing that suffix to enable)
